# Ecosystem

Julia has a fairly rich ecosystem of packages that help you solve many programming
problems.


## What is it?

1. struct-arrays`: package to automatically convert an array of structures into
  a structure of arrays.
1. `gadlfy`: package for creating plots.
1. `gcd.jl`: script to illustrate command line argument handling with Argparse.
