The Julia programming language has gained quite some popularity
over the last couple of years.  What are its strong points, its
weak points?  Is it an elegant language to work with?  Should
you learn it, use it?

This training tries to give you some insights into the language
and how it compares to other similar programming languagues such
as MATLAB and Python so that you can answer these questions for
yourself.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * write Julia expressions;
  * know how to write functions;
  * know the control flow statements;
  * know the data types that Julia supports;
  * learn how to design your code;
  * know how to do file I/O;
  * know how to organize and document your code;
  * learn about the Julia ecosystem.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Julia_good_bad_ugly),
as well as example code.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you want to learn some Julia to see whether
it would work for you.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in some programming language such as Python,
MATLAB, R or C/C++/Fortran.  This is not a training that teaches you how to
program.

If you plan to do Julia programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.
